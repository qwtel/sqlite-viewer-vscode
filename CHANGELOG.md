Please [report](https://github.com/qwtel/sqlite-viewer-vscode/issues) any issues you encounter.

## v0.6.5 (Pre-Release)
_Released on August 28, 2024_

Code refactoring, no externally visible changes 

## v0.6.4 (Pre-Release)

## v0.5
### WAL Mode Support
This version introduces support for __reading WAL mode databases__. It works across all VSCode file systems including local, remote, and even on github.dev.

This fixes a common issue that caused the contents of a `-wal` file not being shown in the UI when the the auto checkpoint limit hadn't been reached.
This led to unsatisfying workarounds such as disabling WAL mode, triggering checkpoints manually or reducing the auto checkpoint limit.

While this update removes the need for the above workarounds, it does not change the readonly nature of the extension or remove the need to reload the file for updates to be visible in the UI.

Note that making this work required significant restructuring of the extension, which may cause (unrelated) issues. Please report any you may encounter. 

## v0.5.13
_Released on May 19, 2024_

- Replaced 3rd party ad with 1st party ad: Check out [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/?ref=vscode), a Jekyll theme for hackers, nerds, and academics, made by yours truly.

## v0.5.12
_Released on May 19, 2024_

- Fixed an issue related to square brackets in column names

## v0.5.11
_Released on May 19, 2024_

- Fixed an issue that caused the update notification to re-appear each time VSCode was restarted

## v0.5.10
_Released on May 19, 2024_

- Fixed an issue that caused an entire file to crash when some tables/views are using custom functions
- Fixed an issue that caused rendering artifacts and column resizing issues in empty tables

## v0.5.9
_Released on July 1, 2024_

Improved column filtering:
- Added a button to invert a column filter
- Added a button to filter a column non-nullish (`NULL` or empty string) values. You can combine it with the invert button to filter for nullish values instead.
- Typing `NULL` or `''` into the column filter will now filter by null or empty string values respectively.
- Changed representation of empty strings from `""` to `''`. This is to match the filter values above and to distinguish it from the legitimate search target `""`, which can come up in combination with JSON(B) columns. If you need to search for the exact string sequence `''`, use escape characters: `\'\'`.
- Fixed a bug that caused column filters to not properly reset when deleting the contents of the search box

Experimental support for Views:
- SQLite Viewer can now view Views. Note that there is a known performance issue for on large views. This feature will retain the "Experimental" qualifier until I can resolve it.
- Added button to expand/collapse all tables and view in the sidebar

## v0.5.8
_Released on June 11, 2024_

- Limiting webview Content Security Policy to environments that are known to work.
This should (finally) make this extension work with GitPod and Google IDX.
- Fixed download button height in detail view 
- Reduced bundle size (< 1MB)

## v0.5.7
_Released on June 10, 2024_

The extension now adds configuration settings for nesting SQLite-related files:

![File nesting screenshot](documentation/nesting.png)

This has no effect if you aren't using VSCode's File Nesting feature. You may enable it in settings under "Explorer > File Nesting: Enabled".

If you use file nesting, but do not want to nest SQLite files, you can manually delete the patterns from the settings page under "Explorer > File Nesting: Patterns". SQLite Viewer will not attempt to set the patterns again, unless explicitly requested through the command "SQLite Viewer: Add SQLite File Nesting Patterns".

This version also changes the file name of downloaded blobs to be prefixed with `-x-`, e.g. `favicons.sqlite-x-moz_icons-10-data.bin`. This ensures that downloaded blobs will be sorted below `-wal`, `-shm` and `-journal` files, reducing the risk of accidentally interacting with them when range-selecting downloaded files.

### Fixes
- Downgraded minimum vscode version to 1.83.1. This should make the Open VSX version of the extension work with Google IDX
- Removed special characters from codicons asset path. This should make icons render correctly when using the Open VSX version of the extension in GitPod
- Fixed an error when setting max file size to 0

## v0.5.6
_Released on June 1, 2024_

Fixed a potential memory issue by limiting memory usage to configured file size limit

## v0.5.5
_Released on June 1, 2024_

Bumped WAL Mode support to main channel.

### Changes

- Minor performance improvement for detail view query

## v0.5.4 (Pre-Release)
_Released on May 23, 2024_

- Generated columns are now shown
- Fixed showing `ROWID` column for tables that were created without row ids

## v0.5.3 (Pre-Release)

_Released on May 18, 2024_

## v0.4
### Solid Rewrite
SQLite Viewer 0.4 is a complete rewrite of this extension with a focus on improved performance.

It also implements SQLite Viewer's **most requested feature**: Default file association for `.db` files! 

Additionally, version 0.4 ships many quality of life improvements:

- Double clicking a cell will now open the modal and pre-select the text content
- The extension will now attempt to auto-size text columns based on visible content on first open
- Blob columns containing known image formats are previewed inline
- Blob columns up to 256 bytes (that aren't images) are rendered in hex format instead of as a download button
- Pinning a row will no longer remove it from the main view
- Columns can now be hidden in the sidebar
- The `ROWID` column can now be displayed (enable in sidebar)
- It is now possible to select and rearrange multiple columns at the same time in the sidebar
- The modal/dialog view can now be resized
- Downloading a blob will now automatically add an appropriate file extension if it can be inferred
- Column sizes and pinned now persist when switching to another table (but not after closing the tab/file) 

### Performance
- Faster virtualized scrolling

### Style
- Many aspects of the extension's UI should match VSCode's style closer
